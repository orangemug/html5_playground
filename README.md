# HTML5 Playground

Experimenting with all this new html5 stuff. The demos include:

 * `looney_404` - Looney tunes style 404 page with keyframe animation and radial gradients
 * `orange_clock` - A **super** over the top clock which shows off touch gestures and transitions

All demos only work in the browsers stated in their README's. This is supposed to be experimental and hence the intention is not for well tested cross browser code.
